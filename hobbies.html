						<h2>Chess</h2>
					<p>I have recently gotten into chess especially that of online chess. I sometimes load up a game on chess.com when I am bored and want to do something semiproductive but fun. I have only played chess for a few months, and my chess.com rating is 1100 but I hope to be able to increase it and to make the chess team in high school.

						<h2>Video Games</h2>
					<p>For the past few years, I have been playing Minecraft, and more specifically bedwars. Bedwars is a mini game on a server within Minecraft. Recently, I have been playing Ranked Bedwars which is an extremely competetive version of bedwars with a ranking system and elo. I also have posted a few videos about bedwars on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sprintzz3988">youtube</a>.

						<h2>Music</h2>
					<p>i started playing piano in 3rd grade, and it was the beginning of my musical journey. I played piano for about a year and a half, and then I didn't play music for about a year after that. When I entered 6th grade, I chose to play the alto saxophone. I started learning how to play the alto saxophone over zoom because of Covid and when we returned to school I played in the Band for 3 years. I also have played in other music groups at my school including the Jazz Band, and the Steel Band. One of the performences with the Steel Band is on <a href="https://youtu.be/U1BOvN4HXzk">youtube</a>.
