						<h2>Sports</h2>
					</header>
					<h2>Track and Field</h2>
					<p>I started running Track in 7th grade and I realized I was quite good at it. My main event is the 400 meter dash. I have also run other sprinting events such as the 100 meter dash and the 200 meter dash, along with their relay counterparts. In my 8th Grade Track and Field season I made state for the 4 by 400 meter relay. At state, I led our relay team as the anchor and got my personal best time of 55.94. I wish to continue with my Track and Field Achievements and break the schoool record in High School.</p>

					<h2>Basketball</h2>
					<p>I started playing basketball in 6th grade and trained to make the team at school. I made the team in both 7th and 8th grade. Our team was one of the best in the conference. I was never a shooter but I am big for my age so I could drive the ball and score layups. What I lacked on offense, I would make up on defense.</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Cross Country</h2>
					<p>I have only done Cross Country for one season and it was mostly to serve as conditioning for the off seaason from Track. I was never the best at it, having a personal best 2 mile time of 12:16. However, Cross Country is a team sport and I qualified for state along with 9 other students from my school. As a team we got 10th at state out of 27 teams that qualified.</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Soccer</h2>
					<p>Soccer was my favorite sport for a long time. When I was 8, I joined a Club along with others from my school. We started off in division 5, which was the lowest division for our league. We worked our way up to division 2 over 3 years. When Covid struck, I stopped playing soccer and have not played since. However, I have played soccer with my friends in the park and I am still deciding if I should trying out for the team with them.</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Non-Competetive Sports</h2>
					<p>I also play a few other sports with my friends that I don't do competetively. These include volleyball, whiffle ball, spike ball, and football.</p>
